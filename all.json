      "description": "CHEYENNE® mock orange outperforms other species and varieties of Philadelphus with its profusion of pure white flowers that blanket the plant late in spring and continue to bloom sporadically until mid-summer. Four-petaled flowers have an eye-catching yellow center and a sweet citrusy fragrance that is sure to satisfy your olfactory senses. Cheyenne Mockorange has a soft texture that is not usually found in native/xeric shrubs and certainly breaks the mold of what many people think a tough, drought-tolerant shrub looks like. The blue-green, oval-shaped leaves and pleasing billowy habit (that can become somewhat vase-shaped with age) make this a perfect plant for a mixed-shrub planting or at the back of a perennial border in a naturalistic landscape. It can get somewhat large with time, but size can be maintained by pruning once blooming has finished. It is a perfect shrub for Colorado as it tolerates poor, heavy soil, even thriving in dry shaded locations.",
